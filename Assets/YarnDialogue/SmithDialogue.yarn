Smith: What? The farm's already save? WOW!
Smith: If you're already so inclined to help us... Will you do it once more?
Smith: I've just finished this sword, for the noble fighter who'll take down the dragon for us. Please have it.
<<getQuestSword Player>>
Smith: Obviously there's no obligation to use this to slay the dragon. But you're probably our best bet anyway. ...Thank you.
